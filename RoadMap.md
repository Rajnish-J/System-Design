# **System Design Roadmap** ðŸš€

System Design is essential for software engineers aiming to build scalable and efficient applications. This roadmap will guide you through mastering both **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**.

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 1: Fundamentals of System Design**
### **1. Understanding System Design & Its Importance**
- Why system design matters in **FAANG** interviews & real-world applications
- Differences between **High-Level Design (HLD) & Low-Level Design (LLD)**
- **Scalability vs. Performance** concepts

### **2. Essential Prerequisites**
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Networking basics (TCP, HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC)
- Operating System concepts (Threads, Locks, Caching)
- Database Fundamentals (SQL vs NoSQL, Transactions, Indexing)
- API Design (REST, GraphQL)

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 2: High-Level Design (HLD)**
### **3. Scalability & Performance**
- Load Balancing (Round Robin, Least Connections, etc.)
- Caching Strategies (Redis, Memcached, CloudFront)
- Sharding & Partitioning Techniques
- Database Replication & Consistency Models

### **4. Architecture & System Components**
- **Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture**
- API Gateways & Service Mesh
- Event-Driven Architecture (Pub/Sub Model, Message Queues)
- **CAP Theorem** & Its Trade-offs in distributed systems

### **5. Advanced Topics in HLD**
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling** (Protecting APIs)
- **Consistent Hashing** (Used in distributed caching)
- **CDN Strategies** (Global distribution of content)
- **Case Studies:** Scalable designs of **Netflix, Uber, WhatsApp, YouTube**

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 3: Low-Level Design (LLD)**
### **6. Object-Oriented Design Principles**
- **SOLID Principles** (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, etc.)
- **DRY, KISS, YAGNI** Best Practices

### **7. Design Patterns**
- **Creational:** Singleton, Factory, Builder
- **Structural:** Adapter, Decorator, Proxy
- **Behavioral:** Observer, Strategy, Command

### **8. Multithreading & Concurrency**
- **Thread Safety, Deadlocks, and Race Conditions**
- **Locking Mechanisms & Optimistic Concurrency Control**

### **9. Designing Scalable Components**
- **REST API & GraphQL Design**
- **Database Schema Design** (Normalization, Indexing, Transactions)
- **Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control**

### **10. Real-World LLD Implementations**
- **Designing a URL Shortener (Bit.ly)**
- **Building a Caching System**
- **Implementing a Rate Limiter**
- **Designing a Logging & Monitoring System**

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 4: Practical Learning & Mock Interviews**
### **11. Real-World System Design Projects**
- Design **Twitter Timeline**, **WhatsApp Messaging**, **YouTube Streaming**
- Build a **Search Engine**, **E-Commerce Platform**, or **Ride-Sharing App**

### **12. Books & Courses to Follow**
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* â€“ Martin Kleppmann
- *System Design Interview* â€“ Alex Xu

### **13. Mock System Design Interviews**
- Practice explaining system design in a **structured approach**
- Use **diagrams & whiteboarding** for clarity
- Get feedback & refine your design strategies

## **ðŸš€ Summary: How to Approach Learning System Design?**
1. **Master the Basics:** Scalability, Databases, Caching, API Design.
2. **Work on Real-Life Problems:** Design **Twitter, Uber, WhatsApp, Netflix**.
3. **Implement LLD in Code:** Use **OOP & Design Patterns**.
4. **Study from Books & Courses:** *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*.
5. **Practice Mock Interviews:** Explain your design step-by-step.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Become proficient in system design for tech interviews & real-world applications!
