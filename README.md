# **System Design - Mastering HLD & LLD** 🚀

Welcome to the **System Design Blueprint** repository! This repo is dedicated to learning, understanding, and implementing **High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts essential for software engineers, backend developers, and aspiring system architects.

## **📌 Overview**
System design is a critical skill for designing **scalable, efficient, and maintainable** software applications. This repository serves as a structured roadmap covering:
- **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Architectural patterns, scalability, and distributed systems.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Object-oriented principles, design patterns, and database schema design.
- **Real-world case studies** of large-scale applications like Netflix, Uber, Twitter, and WhatsApp.
- **Hands-on coding exercises** to reinforce learning.

## **🛠️ Learning Plan**
This repository is divided into structured sections:

### **1️⃣ Fundamentals of System Design**
- Introduction to System Design & its importance.
- Key concepts: **Scalability, Performance, Fault Tolerance, CAP Theorem**.
- Essential prerequisites: **DSA, Networking, OS, API Design, Databases**.

### **2️⃣ High-Level Design (HLD)**
- **Scalability & Performance** (Load balancing, Caching, Sharding, Replication).
- **System Architecture** (Monolithic vs. Microservices, Event-driven, CAP Theorem).
- **Databases** (SQL vs NoSQL, Partitioning, Indexing, Transactions).
- **Message Queues** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub architecture).
- **Case Studies** (Designing Twitter, Uber, WhatsApp, YouTube).

### **3️⃣ Low-Level Design (LLD)**
- **Object-Oriented Principles** (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI).
- **Design Patterns** (Singleton, Factory, Adapter, Observer, Strategy, etc.).
- **Concurrency & Multithreading** (Thread safety, Deadlocks, Locks).
- **REST API & GraphQL Design** (Authentication, Rate Limiting, Best Practices).
- **Database Schema Design** (Normalization, Indexing, Transactions).
- **LLD Case Studies** (Building a URL Shortener, Rate Limiter, Caching System).

### **4️⃣ Hands-On System Design Projects**
- Design **Twitter Timeline**, **YouTube Streaming**, **E-Commerce Platform**.
- Implement real-world **Rate Limiting, Distributed Caching, API Gateway**.
- Mock **System Design Interviews** with whiteboarding & structured explanations.
